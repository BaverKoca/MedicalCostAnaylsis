## => The Datasets i used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance
=> That project i used Medical Cost Personal Datasets on Kaggle and i did regression to find a similar results. <br>
As you can see below of this sentences r2 is 0.8873. <br>
```bash
mse : 16463620.326376956
mae : 2254.868390121926
r2 : 0.8872744462862515
```
!Note: It's explaining very well variation of dataset becasue the closer r2 is to 1, the more successful this project is.!
I used jupyter so you can see schemas-graphs from preview of the codes.
